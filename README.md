Android mobile application for automatic food distributor for hamsters and other rodents.
This app has been written in Java during my last year of High-School within the scope of the Engineer Sciences class project for the French Baccalaureate. It works in relation with a device on a cage and the user has the possibility to choose the amount of food, the frequency and the date at which he wants to feed his pets. Some customization such has the name of each food has been implemented and the possibility to initialize the device of cage by sharing a Wifi profile. Once the profile is received, the device connect by itself to the user's Wifi router and then proceeds different query to an API online written in PHP. All the operations done on the mobile app interact directly with the API, and that's how the user with only an internet connection can feed his pets whenever and wherever he wants.
